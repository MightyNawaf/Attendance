## Attendance System

This system is initially made for my CS dept. in the university, so that each club in the department can register an account and begin by adding each course and its enrolled students and make attendance sheets for each day, but generally this system is not made only for that :)
 
* Excuse my bad taste of choosing proper design as i created this project in 2 days and didn't focus on the looks of it. 
* any suggestion on making new desgin feel free to contact me @ [nawafshawan@gmail.com](mailto:nawafshawan@gmail.com).
